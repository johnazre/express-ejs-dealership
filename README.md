# express-ejs-dealership

### Overview
You were hired by a software consulting firm that is building an inventory management
website and API for a used car dealership. This API must have the following endpoints:
* Get all vehicles
* Get one vehicle
* Add one vehicle
* Edit one vehicle
* Delete one vehicle

The front end must have the following functionality:
* As a user, when I navigate to the home page, I can see a list of all the
  cars.
* As a user, when I am on the home page, there is a anchor tag I can click that will take me to `/add`, which contains a form that I can fill out to add a new vehicle.

### Stretch Goals
* Add an endpoint that can get all vehicles by make
* Add a form that can be filled out that will add a new vehicle to the inventory and redirect the user to the home page when after they click the submit button.
* Add a view that will allow a user to edit a particular vehicle
* Add a button next to each vehicle on the home page that will remove that vehicle from the list

## Directions
* Fork and clone this repo
* Don't worry about adding a config file for Loki.js. One has been added for you in the `db` folder.
* Get it done. Like a boss.
